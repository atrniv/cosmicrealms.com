<p>Over the past decade or so of coding Iâ€™ve had several coding related ideas I wanted to research or experiment with. In many cases I felt that the outcome of the research or experiment would be interestering to others. This blog will be a place where I can post the outcomes of these endeavors.</p>
<p>I hope they prove to be useful to someone someday :)</p>
